# Notes App

This is an application developed thanks to a [Fazt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMn28O1sQGochG94HdlthbA "Fazt Code YouTube") course, using mongoDB, node and express. First, you should run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## :outbox_tray: Run production mode

Run `npm run start` to start the project in developer mode using nodemon.

## :milky_way: Developer mode

Run `npm run dev` to start the project in production mode using node.

## :warning: Note

The **.env** file is ignored but this is the configuration that I had in local.
```
NOTES_APP_MONGODB_HOST=localhost
